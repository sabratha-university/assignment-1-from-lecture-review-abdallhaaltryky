“Java OOP assignment starter project  and UML practice.”

## 🎯 Objective
Practice key OOP concepts in Java by:
- Calculating distance between locations.
- Drawing UML diagrams for class hierarchies.

---

## 🧮 Part 1 – Location Distance
Edit the `Main.java` file and:
1. Replace `myLocation` coordinates with **your current location**.
2. Run the code to calculate distance to **IT College.
3. Identify where **overloading** and **overriding** occur in the code and explain the difference below.

**Answer:**
Overloading vs Overriding
- Overloading:
 Occurs when multiple methods have the same name but different parameters.
 Example: The constructors in SimpleLocation are overloaded.
- Overriding:
 Happens when a subclass provides its own version of a method defined in a superclass.
 Example: In Project2_Shapes, the 'draw()' method in Circle overrides the one in Shape.

## 🎨 Part 2 – UML Diagram
Draw the UML diagram using drwa.io or lucidchart for the Shape example (Shape → Circle → Movable, Adjustable.)
